      <title>Unveiling exozodiacal light</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve put out an article in Physics Today about the story of nulling interferometry to characterize the exozodiacal dust population. Read all about it here.
(The above photo of the Large Binocular Telescope backdropped by the Milky Way was taken by Ryan Ketterer, and Steve Ertel added in the cone of light on the right-hand side to illustrate the disk of zodiacal dust in our own solar system&amp;mdash; which in reality is outside the frame of this image.</description>

      <description>Here is the video recording of my talk &amp;ldquo;Seeing the Light: Hunting for solar systems like our own,&amp;rdquo; part of the University of Notre Dame&amp;rsquo;s public science talk series Our Universe Revealed. The talk abstract is as follows:
A group of astronomers recently carried out a survey of nearby stars, called the “Hunt for Observable Signatures of Terrestrial Systems.” The survey used the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona to measure the faint signals of dust around stars and provide the first realistic hints of discovering Earth-like planets around other stars using future space-based missions.</description>

      <title>An early account of the Maasai</title>
      <link>https://mwanakijiji.github.io/blog/krapf/</link>

      <description>I have translated one of the oldest published accounts of the Maasai (with careful proofreading from my mom). It is the article &amp;ldquo;A short description of the Masai and Wakwafi tribes in southeast Africa&amp;rdquo; which appeared in the journal Das Ausland (Abroad) in 1857. The author was Johann Krapf, a missionary who lived in a village inland from Mombasa from 1846 to 1853. From there, he made a number of travels deep into the East African interior in what is now Kenya and Tanzania.</description>

      <description>[ADS Publications]
I am a postdoc in Jeff Chilcote&amp;rsquo;s research lab at the University of Notre Dame, where I am in charge of testing and upgrading components of the Gemini Planet Imager instrument in preparation for installing it on the Gemini-North telescope in Hawaii. The motivation of this upgrade is to survey for massive planets with low initial starting entropies (i.e., cool planets), and thereby provide additional constraints on the physics of planet formation.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m originally from downstate Illinois, where I dropped out of high school and went to college. From time to time I have bounced around between three continents. In my free time I enjoy scuba diving, international travel, reading excellent writing (here is a reading list), and the great outdoors.
Above: I also enjoy ham radio, and made a WSPR (low-power) radio beacon with a dipole antenna and a Raspberry Pi in my apartment.</description>
