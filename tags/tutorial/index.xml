      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m originally from downstate Illinois, where I dropped out of high school and went to college. From time to time I have bounced around between three continents.
In my free time I enjoy scuba diving, ham radio, international travel, reading excellent writing (here is a reading list), and the great outdoors.
Above: I set up a WSPR (low-power) radio beacon with a dipole antenna and a Raspberry Pi in my apartment.</description>

      <title>An early account of the Maasai</title>

      <description>I have translated one of the oldest published accounts of the Maasai (with careful proofreading from my mom). It is the article &amp;ldquo;A short description of the Masai and Wakwafi tribes in southeast Africa&amp;rdquo; which appeared in the journal Das Ausland in 1857. The author was Johann Krapf, a missionary who lived in a village inland from Mombasa from 1846 to 1853. From there, he made a number of travels deep into the East African interior in what is now Kenya and Tanzania.</description>
