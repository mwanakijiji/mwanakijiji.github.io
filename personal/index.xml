      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m originally from downstate Illinois, where I dropped out of high school and went to college. From time to time I have bounced around between three continents. In my free time I enjoy scuba diving, international travel, reading excellent writing (here is a reading list), and the great outdoors. I also enjoy ham radio, and made a WSPR (low-power) radio beacon with a dipole antenna and a Raspberry Pi in my apartment, and the image above shows a sample of contacts it made in a one-hour period at a wavelength of 20 meters, while consuming 2 watts&amp;mdash; just a little more than a MacBook in sleep mode.</description>
