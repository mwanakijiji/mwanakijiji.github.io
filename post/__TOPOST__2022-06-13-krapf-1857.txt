My mom and I have translated one of the oldest published accounts of the Maasai. It is the article "[A short description of the Masai and Wakwafi tribes in southeast
Africa](/doc/krapf_1857_ausland.pdf)" which appeared in the journal *Das Ausland*
(*Abroad*) in 1857. The author was Johann Krapf, a missionary who lived in a village inland
from Mombasa from 1846 to 1853. From there, he made a number of travels deep into the
East African interior in what is now Kenya and Tanzania. He was the first such traveler, native or foreign,
to write a detailed and lengthy first-hand account of the East African interior, which was published in
1858 in the two-volume set *Reisen in Ost-Afrika* (*Travels in East Africa*). (Krapf also holds the distinction of being the first person to ever mention the Maasai in writing at all, in a letter from 1846.)

The article from *Das Ausland* contains descriptions of coastal and inland geography, and the Maasai,
Wakwafi, Wanika, and other tribes
of the interior, as primarily related to him by an enslaved young man from the
Wakwafi tribe. There are descriptions of the Maasai and Wakwafi pastoral lifestyle;
age sets and political arrangement; the culture of warriorhood and practices in war;
rites of passage like circumcision, marriage, and inhumation; their settlements,
huts, jewelry, and household wares; and their theology, particularly their belief
in a *Neiterkob*, an intermediary between them and the god *Engai*. Krapf also
describes negotiations for the passage of caravans, and mineral deposits and tree
types to be found in the interior.

(This translation was published in *Old Africa* magazine, issues issue 112 (Apr.-May 2024), TBD.)
