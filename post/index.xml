      <description>We had a terrific couple days at USYD at the 9th Australian Exoplanet workshop&amp;ndash; the first such workshop after the worst of the Covid pandemic. There were some sixty-five in-person participants, and about ten more online, with a program featuring talks, a poster session, collaborative sessions, and a panel discussion about the future of the field.

A few of the highlights featured Marshall Perrin&amp;rsquo;s talk &amp;ldquo;Imaging Planetary Systems with JWST,&amp;rdquo; Sergio Leon-Saval&amp;rsquo;s talk (and demo!</description>

      <description>Astrobites.org has posted an article based on my interviews with first-generation college students, and others who have faced more adversity on their journey than is commonly known or talked about. Read the article here. My thanks go to the interviewees for sharing their experiences.</description>

      <title>Unveiling exozodiacal dust</title>
      <link>https://mwanakijiji.github.io/2022/04/01/phys-today/</link>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve put out an article in Physics Today about the story of nulling interferometry to characterize the exozodiacal dust population. Read all about it here.
The above photo of the Large Binocular Telescope backdropped by the Milky Way was taken by Ryan Ketterer, and Steve Ertel added in the cone of light on the right-hand side to illustrate the disk of zodiacal dust in our own solar system&amp;mdash; which in reality is outside the frame of this image.</description>

      <title>The quest for exoplanet direct imaging with ELT apertures</title>
      <link>https://mwanakijiji.github.io/2022/03/18/exoexplorer/</link>

      <description>Here is the video recording of my talk &amp;ldquo;The quest for exoplanet direct imaging with ELT apertures,&amp;rdquo; part of the NASA ExoExplorer 2022 science series.
Abstract: Direct imaging of exoplanets is a promising route to finding and characterizing exoplanets in the thermal infrared. Currently the technique is most sensitive to massive, young planets on wide orbits. Innovative observing techniques are necessary to probe smaller angles from host stars, or search for older or lower-mass planets.</description>

      <description>Here is the video recording of my talk &amp;ldquo;Seeing the Light: Hunting for solar systems like our own,&amp;rdquo; part of the University of Notre Dame&amp;rsquo;s public science talk series Our Universe Revealed.
Abstract: A group of astronomers recently carried out a survey of nearby stars, called the “Hunt for Observable Signatures of Terrestrial Systems.” The survey used the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona to measure the faint signals of dust around stars and provide the first realistic hints of discovering Earth-like planets around other stars using future space-based missions.</description>

      <title>Krapf&#39;s 1857 account of the Maasai</title>

      <description>My mom and I have translated one of the oldest published accounts of the Maasai. It is the article &amp;ldquo;A short description of the Masai and Wakwafi tribes in southeast Africa&amp;rdquo; which appeared in the journal Das Ausland (Abroad) in 1857. The author was Johann Krapf, a missionary who lived in a village inland from Mombasa from 1846 to 1853. From there, he made a number of travels deep into the East African interior in what is now Kenya and Tanzania.</description>
