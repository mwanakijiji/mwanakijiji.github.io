Currently the technique is most sensitive to massive, young planets on wide orbits. Innovative observing techniques are necessary to probe smaller angles from host stars, or search for older or lower-mass planets.","tags":null,"title":"The quest for exoplanet direct imaging with ELT apertures","type":"post","url":"/2022/03/18/exoexplorer/","weight":0,"wordcount":192},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1638230400,"description":"","dir":"post/","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":200,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638230400,"objectID":"1d54b16019c43bd4ec4dcf3ee8d4046e","permalink":"https://mwanakijiji.github.io/2021/11/30/our-universe-revealed/","publishdate":"2021-11-30T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/2021/11/30/our-universe-revealed/","section":"post","summary":"Here is the video recording of my talk \u0026ldquo;Seeing the Light: Hunting for solar systems like our own,\u0026rdquo; part of the University of Notre Dame\u0026rsquo;s public science talk series Our Universe Revealed.\nAbstract: A group of astronomers recently carried out a survey of nearby stars, called the “Hunt for Observable Signatures of Terrestrial Systems.” The survey used the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona to measure the faint signals of dust around stars and provide the first realistic hints of discovering Earth-like planets around other stars using future space-based missions.","tags":null,"title":"Our Universe Revealed","type":"post","url":"/2021/11/30/our-universe-revealed/","weight":0,"wordcount":114},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1632960000,"description":"","dir":"post/","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":300,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632960000,"objectID":"3412bb43206761922548511eb0417ab7","permalink":"https://mwanakijiji.github.io/2021/09/30/krapf-1857/","publishdate":"2021-09-30T00:00:00Z","readingtime":2,"relpermalink":"/2021/09/30/krapf-1857/","section":"post","summary":"I have translated one of the oldest published accounts of the Maasai (with careful proofreading from my mom).
