Currently the technique is most sensitive to massive, young planets on wide orbits. Innovative observing techniques are necessary to probe smaller angles from host stars, or search for older or lower-mass planets. The Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) is in a unique position to push these frontiers in preparation for the era of 30-m-class extremely large telescopes. When light is combined coherently in a \u0026ldquo;Fizeau\u0026rdquo; mode between the LBT\u0026rsquo;s twin 8.4-m sub-telescopes, the facility effectively becomes a masked 22.7-m telescope. I will present an observation of the nearby star Altair in this mode, which represents the first LBT Fizeau dataset with a degree of automated phase control. These data constrain the existence of companions of 1.3 M⊙ down to an inner angle of ≈0.15\u0026quot;, closer than any previously published direct imaging of Altair. I outline ways forward, in terms of software and physical upgrades, and post-processing with longer integration times.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","tags":null,"title":"The quest for exoplanet direct imaging with ELT apertures","type":"post","url":"/2022/03/18/exoexplorer/","weight":0,"wordcount":192},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1638230400,"description":"","dir":"post/","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":200,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638230400,"objectID":"1d54b16019c43bd4ec4dcf3ee8d4046e","permalink":"https://mwanakijiji.github.io/2021/11/30/our-universe-revealed/","publishdate":"2021-11-30T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/2021/11/30/our-universe-revealed/","section":"post","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"/img/revealed.jpeg\" alt=\"Our Universe Revealed\"\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere is the video recording of my talk \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gKKHhJsuMY\"\u003eSeeing the Light: Hunting for solar systems like our own\u003c/a\u003e,\u0026rdquo;\npart of the University of Notre Dame\u0026rsquo;s public science talk series \u003cem\u003eOur Universe\nRevealed\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbstract: \u003cem\u003eA group of astronomers recently carried out a survey of nearby stars, called the “Hunt for Observable Signatures of Terrestrial Systems.” The survey used the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona to measure the faint signals of dust around stars and provide the first realistic hints of discovering Earth-like planets around other stars using future space-based missions.
